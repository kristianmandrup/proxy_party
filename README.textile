h1. Proxy Party

Greatly facilitates adding proxies through the proxy method_missing pattern. 
Can now also dynamically add proxy methods and use other amazing meta strategies!

h2. Install

@$ gem install party_proxy@

h2. Use

@require 'party_proxy'@

h2. Latest news

Now supports renaming of proxy method so you can avoid method name collisions!

h2. TODO

Major DRYing up needed. Currently a lot of code duplication :O

h2. Usage

<pre>
  class State
    attr_accessor :name

    def initialize(name)
      @name = name    
    end  
  end  

  class Info
    attr_accessor :text

    def initialize(text)
      @text = text    
    end  
  end  

  module Party 
    class Subject
      # proxy state and info objects to make their methods 
      # directly accessible from subject objects
      proxy :state, :info

      def initialize(name)
        @state = State.new name
        @info = Info.new 'hello'      
      end
    end

h2. Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
